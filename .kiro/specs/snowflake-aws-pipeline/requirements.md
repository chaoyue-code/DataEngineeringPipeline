# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a comprehensive data pipeline that extracts data from Snowflake as the upstream source and processes it through AWS services including Glue, S3, Lambda, and SageMaker. The entire infrastructure will be managed using Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices. The pipeline will enable automated data extraction, transformation, storage, and machine learning capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to extract data from Snowflake automatically, so that I can process large datasets without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pipeline is triggered THEN the system SHALL connect to Snowflake using secure credentials
2. WHEN data extraction begins THEN the system SHALL extract data in configurable batch sizes to optimize performance
3. WHEN extraction completes THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity and log extraction metrics
4. IF extraction fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and alert on persistent failures

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to store extracted data in S3, so that I can have a reliable data lake for downstream processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is extracted from Snowflake THEN the system SHALL store it in S3 with appropriate partitioning
2. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL apply compression and optimal file formats (Parquet/Delta)
3. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL implement lifecycle policies for cost optimization
4. WHEN storing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL encrypt data at rest and in transit

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to transform data using AWS Glue, so that I can clean and prepare data for analytics and ML workloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN raw data arrives in S3 THEN Glue crawlers SHALL automatically discover schema and update the data catalog
2. WHEN transformation is needed THEN Glue ETL jobs SHALL process data according to business rules
3. WHEN transformations complete THEN the system SHALL validate data quality and generate data lineage
4. IF transformation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error logs and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to orchestrate the pipeline using Lambda functions, so that I can have serverless, event-driven processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data events occur THEN Lambda functions SHALL trigger appropriate pipeline stages
2. WHEN orchestrating workflows THEN Lambda SHALL manage state and handle error conditions
3. WHEN processing completes THEN Lambda SHALL send notifications and update monitoring dashboards
4. WHEN errors occur THEN Lambda SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns and escalation procedures

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to use SageMaker for ML workloads, so that I can build and deploy machine learning models on the processed data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clean data is available THEN SageMaker SHALL access it for model training and inference
2. WHEN models are trained THEN the system SHALL version and store model artifacts
3. WHEN deploying models THEN SageMaker SHALL provide scalable inference endpoints
4. WHEN model performance degrades THEN the system SHALL trigger retraining workflows

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want all infrastructure managed through Terraform, so that I can ensure consistent, reproducible deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying infrastructure THEN Terraform SHALL provision all AWS resources with proper configurations
2. WHEN making changes THEN Terraform SHALL provide plan previews and safe deployment practices
3. WHEN managing environments THEN Terraform SHALL support multiple environments (dev/staging/prod)
4. WHEN resources are created THEN Terraform SHALL apply appropriate tags and security policies

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring and alerting, so that I can ensure pipeline reliability and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL collect metrics on performance, cost, and data quality
2. WHEN anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL send alerts through multiple channels
3. WHEN investigating issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs and tracing information
4. WHEN SLAs are at risk THEN the system SHALL automatically scale resources or trigger failover procedures

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want proper access controls and encryption, so that sensitive data is protected throughout the pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing Snowflake THEN the system SHALL use IAM roles and secure credential management
2. WHEN data flows between services THEN all communication SHALL be encrypted in transit
3. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL implement encryption at rest with proper key management
4. WHEN users access resources THEN the system SHALL enforce least privilege access principles
